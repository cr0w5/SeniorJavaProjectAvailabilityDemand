# SeniorJavaProjectAvailabilityDemand
Final Project for CSE 460 Software Analysis and Design

Project: Availability-Demand Software System for B&B 

Description: Created a java project following the publisher-subscriber design pattern to allow companies to publish rooms for booking and customers to subscribe/unsubscribe for notification of specific rooms to book. 

Note: There are no comments in the code because the profesor requested the comments to be in Diagram.asta where different diagrams were created to represent the program.
